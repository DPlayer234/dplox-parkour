# DPlox Parkour

This is the original source code for my game "DPlox Parkour". [GameJolt Site](https://gamejolt.com/games/dplox-parkour/156079)

The code is genuinely terrible, but I wanted to have it here for the sake of completion since the game is free anyway.

Take this as a bad example for writing code. Basically none of the things done here on a code-level are good, such as over-reliance on global variables, long code files, long functions, and excessive branching-logic. Additionally, the folder structure is... non-existent. As such, the sequel uses virtually none of this code.

It comes with a compatible (old) version of my debugger utility, so you can inspect variables at run-time by pressing F4.

The only thing I ask you to not do is use this to cheat the GameJolt trophy system.
