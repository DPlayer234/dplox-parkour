The deviations (deviantart.com) mentioned might offend people/contain content inappropriate for pre-teens.
(If you're pre-teen, I'd like to note that most people on the internet hate the general behavior of your age group. :P)
I also don't claim to have made the deviations; they were made by their respective creators!
OC is for Original Character, aka they're my own creation. You may not claim to have made them.
Despite all this, I have created all the in-game graphics.
(Oh, and characters which aren't in the folder are just planned and may not appear at all.)
